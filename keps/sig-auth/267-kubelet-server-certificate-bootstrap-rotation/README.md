## Summary

This is retrospective KEP description for the feature `RotateKubeletServerCertificate`.

The feature gate `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` allows to configure kubelet to
get a server certificate for the kubelet from the Certificate Signing Request
API instead of generating one self signed and auto rotates the certificate as
expiration approaches.

## Motivation

The feature is heavily used and is a part of [CIS Kubernetes benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes):

> 1.3.6	Ensure that the `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` argument is set to true

This indicates feature maturity and high production readiness.

The outstanding work of generalizing the approach certificate requests got
approved will require a new KEP.


### Goals

- ability to configure kubelet to get a server certificate for the kubelet from
  the Certificate Signing Request API instead of generating one self signed
- auto-rotate the certificate nearing expiration using Certificate Signing
  Request API

### Non-Goals

- built-in support for approving CSRs nodes request (not currently done because
  there is not a way to determine if a node controls a given IP or DNS name)
- ability to limit the addresses/hostnames a node requests in its cert
  (currently, nodes request all addresses reported by the cloud provider, and
  the selection of which address to use is done on the API server side)

## Proposal

Documentation for the feature can be found here:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#certificate-rotation

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

The note about default implementation that will not approve certificate requests
is already a part of documentation. See the Note on this page: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#certificate-rotation

### Risks and Mitigations

The feature was in heavy production use for a while. Likely no risks will emerge
with locking the feature gate.

## Design Details

Here are limited design definition for the retrospective KEP.

Implementation PRs:
- Feature gate introduced: [#45059](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45059)
- Feature promoted to GA: [#51045](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51045)

### Test Plan

Configuration testing is already done.

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

None

##### Unit tests

There is a unit test coverage for the certificate manager.

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

None found.

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

##### e2e tests

None found.

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

N/A: this is retroactive KEP, feature is already in Beta

#### Beta

N/A: this is retroactive KEP, feature is already in Beta

#### GA

- [x] Feature is actively used with the positive feedback
- [ ] Metrics promoted to GA:
  - `certificate_manager_server_rotation_seconds`
  - `certificate_manager_server_ttl_seconds`
  - `server_expiration_renew_errors`
- [ ] There are conformance tests for the certificates API endpoint, functionality
  itself do not require covering with conformance tests
- [ ] Documentation created: https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/30575

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Feature exists for a long time, no risk for Upgrade/Downgrade.

### Version Skew Strategy

Feature exists for a long time, no risk for version skew.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

Feature exists for a long time, no risk for Enablement and Rollback.

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

Configuration settings must be used - command line argument
(`--rotate-server-certificates`: deprecated) or Node config flag
`serverTLSBootstrap`.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No, unless kubelet uses special config.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Kubelet will not start unless configuration will be changed to useself-signed
certificate.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

N/A

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

N/A

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

N/A


###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

N/A

### Monitoring Requirements

N/A

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

Yes, using metrics 

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

N/A

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

Metrics can be used to determine the speed of cert update.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

- Certificate Signing Request API. This API is GA.
- Configuration to approve signing requests.

This feature only works when properly configured.

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No

### Scalability

Certificate signing requests for rotating the cert are executed on TTL
expiration. This should not introduce any scalability challenges.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

Yes, certificate signing requests.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No

### Troubleshooting

Failure to get certificate can be troubleshooted using logs.

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

- If it's a bootstrap, kubelet will not become functional.
- If it is a rotation, kubelet will become non-functional unless will be able to
  renew the certificate.

###### What are other known failure modes?

None

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

- alpha: "v1.7"
- beta: "v1.12"


## Drawbacks

None

## Alternatives
